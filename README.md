# SpartaGameProject
This is my Video Game Project for my time during training with Sparta Global

I took some inspiration from a game called Cuphead in which one of the final levels you come across "Dice man" in which you have to roll a dice and based on the input, move that amount of spaces and then face either a boss or a mini game. I decided this would be a good creative idea to use and with two weeks created the simple Game, using 3 mini games.

I created the game using Winforms which was quite challenging because i had done a lot of game creation with Unity so knew the libraries for that, rather than knowing how to do the same things in Winforms. I took some time to see what kind of libraries Winforms with c# had and was able to translate a lot of knowledge from my unity game creation into using Winforms for my game. In the end I feel like I learned a lot from using Winforms to create a game, from understanding simple things like how two objects can interact with eachother, to slightly trickier things like changing forms and find open forms, to even understanding that i had to make sure all the Forms were closed, not just hidden when I closed the game.
